# RFC
Discussion about design decisions on Project Link.

Many changes to Project Link can be handled simply, through Github issues, Pull Requests or Mailing-List conversations. However, some larger or subtler changes, which may need highly technical discussions, need a different format and process.

In Project Link, such discussions take the form of Requests For Comments (or RFCs) and they live on this repository.

## Submitting

If you wish to submit a new RFC:

1. If there is no Issue describing what you wish to improve, [file an Issue](https://github.com/fxbox/RFC/issues);
2. Put together a document describing your RFC, in pure text or Markdown format â€“ it should live in directory `text/`;
3. Submit a Pull Request with your document and mention the Pull Request in the Issue;
4. Start the conversation on the [dev-project-link](https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-project-link) mailing-list.
